            <h3>I have a deep passion for technology, this whole website is about it. Here, we can explore more of my interests besides the obvious.</h3>

                <h2>Basketball</h2>
                <h3>Since I was a kid, basketball was my number 1 sport to play. At the age of 10 I joined a basketball club in my primary school. At the age of 13 I was playing for my town's team. I played in the first squad (as PG/SG) in my age group until the age of 19 when I started to develop problems with my knees. Ultimately, I only play for fun now.</h3>
                <h3>Yes, that is me going for a double-handed dunk. I am only 182 cm tall. I trained hard to jump so high. Now we know where the knee problems came from.</h3>
                <h3>PS Pardon the quality, this was taken in 2013 or so...</h3>

                <h2>Motorsports</h2>
                <h3>Since I was a kid, I was always into cars. I always enjoyed looking at cars, especially those which were modified. My brain is all for German cars but my heart leans towards JDM classics, such as the Nissan Silvia S15 in the image.</h3>
                <h3>I really like Rally and Drifting and I am a hands-on, rather than sit & watch person. Since the sport is quite expensive, I could only afford to build a sim racing rig and get a gaming PC.</h3>
                <h3>In my free time, I relax and destress by driving/drifting/racing in games such as Assetto Corsa.</h3>
                <h3>YES, I like F1, too!</h3>

                <h2>Travel</h2>
                <h3>Who does not like traveling, right? Unfortunately, the pandemic did not allow me to travel much recently. I am really hoping to change that this year.</h3>
                <h3>Last summer, I went to visit Prague, Czech Republic with my fiance and my friends. I totaly recommend it!</h3>
                <h3>I think next, I want to go somewhere hot and nice, such as Dominican Republic to get away from rainy reality in the UK. On the other hand one of my best friends is from China and has invited us over many times.</h3>
                <h3>Maybe... both?</h3>
